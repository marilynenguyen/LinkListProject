# LinkListProject
Object-Oriented Programming II Course - Project 3

This program was a team project. We learned more about linked lists and develop methods (insert a new element in the list, find a certain 
element in the list, delete an element from the list, ect.) to use on them. We also used File I/O concepts to read files.
